## About Me
Hi! I am Egor, I am 32 years old. Previously, I worked as an SEO specialist, and also ran advertising campaigns in Yandex.Direct. Recently I decided to change activities and start programming. I love to study and know how to be productively engaged in this, psychological and pedagogical education helps me and the fact that I am constantly experiencing information hunger. I will learn and become a developer because I believe that this path will make my life better, more meaningful and more interesting! I also love to study biology, psychology and other areas of scientific knowledge. I go hiking, traveling, doing fitness. I love electronics, gadgets, listen to a lot of different music, read (popular science, science fiction, science fiction literature, etc.)
